# 1D-FFT
1D FFT RISC V


As for the project guidelines, it was needed a working Vectorized RISC_V complete 1D FFT [Fast Fourier Transform] code.

We started the project with the basics:

=>Step 1 was the making C files for all the important components for FFT.
-> Bit Reversal
-> Butterfly and twiddle factor

=>Step 2 was converting these chunks into RISC-V scalar and combine them to make a recursive FFT. 

=>Step 3 was to Convert the fully working Scalar to into Vector 1d FFT.


The files attached are of Step 1 and Step 2.
